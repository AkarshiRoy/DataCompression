Data compression refers to the process of condensing data, in order to minimize transmission time and occupy minimum storage space. 
It can be classified as lossy and lossless. 
This project focuses on the execution and comparison of three different algorithms of lossless data compression, namely the na√Øve approach (our approach), the Huffman approach, and the Shannon-Fano approach. 
The logical inference asserting that Huffman coding is the most efficient technique; has been verified by comparing the comparison ratios of the three methods.
